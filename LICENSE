SPECIAL CONDITIONS FOR NEXUS DERIVATIVES:

1. MEMORY SAFETY REQUIREMENT
   Any derivative work must be provably memory-safe. The derivative must
   include formal verification of memory safety properties and must not
   emit undefined behavior under any circumstances.

2. Γ-AST HASH CHAIN PUBLICATION
   Any derivative work must publish its complete Γ-AST hash chain for
   cryptographic verification. This includes all intermediate compilation
   steps and final output hashes.

3. NO UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
   No derivative work may emit undefined behavior, regardless of input.
   All edge cases must be handled explicitly and safely.

4. VERIFICATION ARTIFACTS
   All mathematical proofs and verification artifacts must be included
   with the derivative work, ensuring complete transparency and verifiability.

5. COMPLIANCE REPORTING
   Derivatives must include a compliance report demonstrating adherence
   to all NPL requirements, with evidence of verification and testing.

VIOLATION OF THESE CONDITIONS:
Failure to comply with any of these special conditions constitutes a
violation of the NPL and may result in legal action to enforce compliance
or prevent distribution of non-compliant derivatives.
