- Attempted to fix borrow checker issue in parse_expression method
- Tried 3 different approaches to resolve the borrowing conflict
- Issue persists: cannot borrow `*self` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable

- Calling self.advance() requires mutable borrow of self
- Parser module 95% complete but blocked by this compilation error
- Need assistance to resolve the borrow checker issue
