# NEXUS - Universal Language Bridge with Advanced Pattern Recognition

## **🚨 CRITICAL: DRIFT LOCKDOWN SYSTEM ACTIVE - ZERO TOLERANCE**

**✅ COMPREHENSIVE DRIFT PREVENTION IMPLEMENTED - NO MORE AGENT CONFUSION!**

**What Happened**: Our project experienced significant drift due to agents building test files and alternative implementations in wrong locations, causing handoff confusion where the next agent would think test files were the real system.

**What We Fixed**: Implemented a bulletproof drift lockdown system that ensures agents can NEVER see test files or alt paths again.

**Current Status**: **DRIFT LOCKDOWN ACTIVE - ZERO TOLERANCE** with comprehensive prevention protocols.

---

## **🔒 DRIFT LOCKDOWN SYSTEM - ABSOLUTE ZERO TOLERANCE**

### **🚫 INSTANT BLOCKING OFFENSES:**
1. **Building test files outside `/tests/` folder**
2. **Creating alternative versions of existing components**
3. **Building in `/cleanup/` or temporary folders**
4. **Creating duplicate implementations**
5. **Handing off test files as real systems**

### **✅ ONLY LEGITIMATE BUILD PATHS:**
- **Core System**: `/src/` folder ONLY
- **Enhanced Components**: `/working_code/` folder ONLY
- **Tests**: `/tests/` folder ONLY
- **Documentation**: `/docs/` folder ONLY
- **Logs**: `/logs/` folder ONLY

### **🔍 AUTOMATED DRIFT DETECTION:**
- **`DRIFT_DETECTOR.py`** - Automated script that agents MUST run before starting work
- **Real-time drift detection** - Prevents any drift from occurring
- **Immediate blocking** - Any drift attempt results in instant work stoppage
