## üö´ BANNED FUNCTIONS (DESTRUCTIVE/OVERHEAD)

### Explicitly Banned:
- `apply_aggressive_byte_compression` - **DESTRUCTIVE** (removes nodes)
- `apply_smart_pattern_compression` - **OVERHEAD** (adds complexity)
- `apply_content_aware_compression` - **STRUCTURAL DAMAGE** (breaks AST topology)
- `apply_byte_level_compression` - **STRUCTURAL DAMAGE** (modifies node references)
- `apply_advanced_pattern_clustering` - **STRUCTURAL DAMAGE** (alters children arrays)

### Why Banned:
1. **Destructive Operations:** Functions that call `ast.nodes.remove()` break AST integrity
2. **Structural Damage:** Functions that modify children arrays or node references break parent-child relationships
3. **Overhead:** Complex algorithms add more bytes than they save
4. **Non-Lossless:** Any function that breaks structural integrity fails the lossless requirement
